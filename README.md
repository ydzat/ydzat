## Hi there 👋 / 嗨你好 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently developing two synergistic projects:

    - [moeai-c](https://gitlab.dongzeyang.top/ydzat/moeai-c): An AI automation assistant designed for deep Linux integration. Leveraging my ongoing Linux Kernel Programming studies, I aim to evolve it into a system-level tool with capabilities like process调度优化 and in-kernel AI inference.

    - [KnowForge](https://github.com/ydzat/knowforge): An AI-powered knowledge refinery that transforms unstructured inputs (PDFs/code/images/web) into structured notes (Markdown/Jupyter/PDF). Core tech stack:
      - Multi-modal Pipeline: OCR + NLP + ChromaDB
      - LLM Orchestration
      - Linux-Native Future

    - [AntiCheatVM](https://github.com/ydzat/AntiCheatVM): A command-line toolkit to build optimized Windows virtual machines on Linux, aiming to make anti-cheat-protected games like Wuthering Waves, Rainbow Six Siege, and APEX Legends runnable.

    - [Logloom](https://github.com/ydzat/Logloom): A lightweight, cross-language logging system designed to unify log formats, support multilingual output, and prepare logs for intelligent analysis.
By weaving structured data from different programs into a coherent framework, Logloom lays the foundation for future AI-driven diagnostics, anomaly detection, and system self-optimization.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Machine Learning, Linux Kernel Programming, Software Language Engineering, Reinforcement Learning and Learning-based Control, and Concepts and Models for Parallel and Data-centric Programming. I’ll likely start my Master’s thesis next semester.  
  / 我目前在学习《高级机器学习》《Linux 内核编程》《软件语言工程》《强化学习和基于学习的控制》以及《并行和以数据中心编程的概念和模型》，预计下学期开始撰写硕士论文。

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects in AI, system-level automation, or language tooling.  
  / 我希望参与一些与 AI、系统自动化或语言工具相关的创新项目。

- 🤔 I’m looking for work opportunities, ideally in AI, Game Development, VR, Parallel Programming, or Software Engineering.  
  / 我正在寻找工作机会，优先考虑 AI、游戏开发、虚拟现实、并行编程或软件工程相关领域。

- 💬 Ask me about Python automation, RL experiments, Linux development, or studying Computer Science in Germany.  
  / 欢迎与我交流 Python 自动化、强化学习实验、Linux 系统开发，或德国计算机专业学习体验。

  / 联系方式：ydzat@live.com

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him / 他

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once wrote a script to automate appointment booking at the German Ausländerbehörde, just to secure a slot — but apparently, they’re on vacation every day! 😅  
  / 有趣事实：我曾写过脚本自动刷德国外管局的预约系统，只为抢到一个名额——可惜他们好像天天在放假！😅
